    desc: `In this article, we will discuss the Binary Search Algorithm. Searching is the process of finding some particular element in the list. If the element is present in the list, then the process is called successful, and the process returns the location of that element. Otherwise, the search is called unsuccessful.

Linear Search and Binary Search are the two popular searching techniques. Here we will discuss the Binary Search Algorithm.

Binary search is the search technique that works efficiently on sorted lists. Hence, to search an element into some list using the binary search technique, we must ensure that the list is sorted.

Binary search follows the divide and conquer approach in which the list is divided into two halves, and the item is compared with the middle element of the list. If the match is found then, the location of the middle element is returned. Otherwise, we search into either of the halves depending upon the result produced through the match.`,
